##About

This project was created as my introduction to React and it's interaction with APIs
As of the first commit it is a simple, single component web app for reading the bible. The app makes use of the https://scripture.api.bible/ web api 
for getting the content. 

##The next steps are to :
1. Split out the test.js components into multiple components and manage the state from the main component
2. Add feedback when a chapter is selected
3. Split the left pane into 2 columns and possibly have an OT/NT button so the side pane list is not so long
4. Add in Next and Previous chapter Buttons
5. Improve the styling of the page.
